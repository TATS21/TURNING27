        <p>I wish to let you know that i am very happy to have you as a friend or something more,i don't really
             know.
            Not only have you supported me whenever i needed you but also offered me your friendship and love.
            I admire you a lot because you are a great human being and your sense of creativity which
             i am so much in love with.</p>
             <p>I truly feel blessed you have become a part of my life.You inspire me alot
                 which helps me a lot to overcome my limitaion and makes me become a better person.
                You have positively affected my life in various ways, even in ways that you have never thought
                 of yourself.It would be ideal to give you everything you want and need,
                 but the most precious thing i have to give you is my unconditional and unfailing love
                 {It sounded better in my head,LoL..}</p>
                 <p>If wisdom and experience were wealth,you would be one of the richest person i have ever met.
                    You really make everything have a deeper meaning <em>sometimes</em> and sometimes you say
                     rubbish.I admire you for your hardwork and dedication.I really do wish you success in 
                     your career and everything you do.
                 </p>
