        <p> Your presence in my life is God's way of telling me that he cares for me. I may not have told you, 
            but I strongly feel that I have found a true friend like you because of good karma. 
            You have always understood me, heard me, supported me, and believed in me. 
             Thank you for always being there for me. I am sorry that I didn’t thank you before. 
            The words just never came to me, but I want you to know that you are among the most important
             people in my life. This thank you would not be enough to describe all the things you do for me. 
             but I must say that my time with you taught me a lot about myself and
              the different things we can communicate with each other.</p>
              <p>I’ve never met a man so caring and loving as you. With each passing day, 
                I can’t thank you enough
                 for being such a particular person in my life. You are one of the few people
                  that I am blessed to 
                call a friend. Thank you for always being there for me and lending an ear when I needed it
                 most. I am so lucky to have you as a friend, 
                Thank you for the love you always give to me, even when I don’t deserve it. You stay in my
                 heart forever.</p>
                 <p>Thank you for always putting a smile on my face when I need it most, for being there to 
                    lean on when I need someone, And not only do you help me, but you are always there to 
                    support and care for me when  I need it most. You go above and beyond, even though I
                     know you have your problems to  deal with sometimes. </p>
                     <p>There are no words that can express my gratitude for having such an amazing friend
                         like you and thank you for being one of the most incredible friends anyone could
                          ever ask for. Please know that  I am so grateful to have you in my life</p>
                          <p>A lot of times, I am amazed at your strength and resilience. Thank you for the way 
                            you inspire me to be better and the times you have come through for me.</p>
                            <p>Thank you for always believing that i am something more, than what i am now.</p>
                            <p>I appreciate the fact that you appreciate me.</p>
